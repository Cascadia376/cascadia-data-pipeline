- **Use agents for code reviews** by asking them to analyze existing code

### **Quality Assurance:**

- Always request **comprehensive error handling**
- Ask for **TypeScript types** and **documentation**
- Require **test coverage** for all major features
- Request **performance considerations** and **optimization**
